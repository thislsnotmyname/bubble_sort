# bubble_sort
This project is to create a Ruby method that utilizes the principles of [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort).
(As an added bonus, there is also a method to generate an array of random numbers to test with.)
This project was made as an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-bubble-sort).
